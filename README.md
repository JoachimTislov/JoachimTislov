<h2 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Joachim Tislov</h2>
<h5 align="center">A software engineer from Norway</h5>

I'm a passionate programmer who strives for <strong>simplicity</strong>, <strong>readability</strong> and <strong>performance</strong>. I believe that the challenge of resolving bugs often stems from knowledge gaps, and I therefore rarely back down from tackling them to fill those gaps. You're essentially only a well-crafted query away from resolving them — and knowing how to construct that query is the core of software engineering
